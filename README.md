## Introduction
In recent times many processes and activities have been taking the help of digitalization and are carried out online. The admission process in various professional courses is now a day done online. However, some tasks are still carried out manually such as the details and document verification task. The process of verification can be taken over by Automation. With the help of Robotic Process Automation (RPA), R.P.A.A.M.S aims on assisting the faculty to automate the verification task on hand.

## Objective 
1. Automate the Document and Details Verification process.
2. Check the Accuracy of the details and supporting documents.
3. Increase speed and productivity.

## Scope
To achieve the aims & objectives of this project, the emphasis is on identifying the main features that are involved in the system. For automating the process, we will use RPA web scraping, OCR where the user can check the accuracy of the documents and details with minimum effort. The scope covers the objective of reducing human errors and increasing throughput.

R.P.A.A.M.S will use Automation Anywhere for supporting the automation process.IQ bots and
task bots will scrape data from the forms and supporting documents. After comparing the data based on the results the students will get verification emails or emails containing the errors that need to be updated
